# ðŸ§  Problem Analysis & Research

## Problem Statement

People moving to a new city often struggle to find neighborhoods that match their lifestyle and priorities (e.g., safety, affordability, greenery). Most real estate platforms focus on property listings, not lifestyle-fit.

## User Research & Assumptions

We assumed users:
- Value lifestyle attributes like safety, affordability, greenery, etc.
- Want neighborhood suggestions based on personal preferences
- May not have technical or local knowledge to analyze cities manually

## Existing Solutions (Gaps Identified)

- **MagicBricks / 99acres / NoBroker**: Focus on price/property, not lifestyle
- **Google Maps**: Good for exploring, but no match suggestions
- **Niche.com / WalkScore**: Available only in Western countries

## Hypothesis

> If we let users input their lifestyle preferences and match them with real neighborhood data, they can make better living decisions.

## Data-Driven Validation

To validate this, we:
- Collected real city data (Hyderabad, Bangalore, Mumbai)
- Added mock neighborhoods with lifestyle attributes
- Created a scoring algorithm to match based on user input

## Summary

Our app bridges the gap between real estate browsing and lifestyle-based decision making by combining personal preferences with city-specific data using a custom algorithm.
